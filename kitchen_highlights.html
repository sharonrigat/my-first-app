         <h2 style="color: red;"> MEMORIES IN MY KITCHEN VIA PICTURES</h2>
         <p>I get really <strong>lazy</strong> being in the <b>kitchen</b> cooking, but the few times i do i try to make the most out of it by <ins>keeping</ins> <em>memories</em> of pictures or videos,i take mostly videos tho, but i have few pictures i could share It is suprising whearas i used to love cooking, but now i am such a lazy ass. I try to keep memories of my meals mostly via videos, sadly i have only few pictures to share. But i guess it would leave you all mesmerized LOL</p>
